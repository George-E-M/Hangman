# Hangman
This is a personal project, it is an implementation of hangman using javafx

To run it simply download the jar file, and in the terminal move to the directory containing the file and execute it using:

java -jar Hangman.jar

Make sure that the words.txt file is in the same directory as the jar file or the application will not work as intended.
